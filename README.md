# Aosong ASAIR AHT1x/AHT2x

This is an Arduino library for _Aosong ASAIR_ AHT10/AHT15/AHT20/AHT21/AHT25/AM2301**B**/AM2311**B** Digital Humidity & Temperature Sensor

- AHT1x +1.8v..+3.6v, AHT2x +2.2v..+5.5v
- AHT1x 0.25uA..320uA, AHT2x 0.25uA..980uA
- temperature range -40C..+85C
- humidity range 0%..100%
- typical accuracy T +-0.3C, RH +-2% **(1)**
- typical resolution T 0.01C, RH 0.024%
- normal operating range T -20C..+60C, RH 10%..80%
- maximum operating rage T -40C..+80C, RH 0%..100%
- I2C bus speed 100KHz..400KHz, 10KHz recommended minimum
- recommended measurement frequency 8sec..30sec **(2)**
- recommended to route VDD or GND between I2C lines to reduce crosstalk between SCL & SDA
- power supply pins must be decoupled with 100nF capacitor

Supports all sensors features:
- read humidity **(3)**
- read temperature **(3)**
- soft reset with sensor initialization
- CRC calculation for AHT2x **(3)**

Tested on:
- Arduino AVR
- Arduino ESP8266
- Arduino ESP32
- Arduino STM32

**(1)** Prolonged exposure for 60 hours at humidity > 80% can lead to a temporary drift of the signal +3%. Sensor slowly returns to the calibrated state at normal operating conditions.<br>
**(2)** Measurement with high frequency leads to heating of the sensor, must be > 2 seconds apart to keep self-heating below 0.10C.<br>
**(3)** Library returns 255 if a communication error occurs, calibration coefficient is off or CRC doesn't match (for AHT2x only).
